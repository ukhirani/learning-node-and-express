History of Node.js
- Creator : Ryan Dahl

Non Blocking I/O

Q. What is Non Blocking I/O ?
A method that allows running multiple pieces of code in parallel on a single thread using an event loop, enabling concurrent processing without requiring additional computer resources like multiple threads

Q. What is Event loop
The event loop acts as a registry for work that needs to be done, scheduling tasks on specific timers and calling functions when the work is completed, allowing parallel processing of tasks

Q. What is the key difference between blocking and non-blocking code?
In blocking code, tasks execute sequentially from top to bottom, while in non-blocking code, subsequent lines can execute before previous asynchronous tasks complete, enabling parallel processing

- js is weird as it's one of the only languages where the language itself isn't the runtime



Browser vs. Node.js
- node doesn't have access to the DOM

- Node.js is a runtime environment for JavaScript, using the same language syntax, but with different available globals, packages, and capabilities compared to browser-based JavaScript

- Browser-specific functions like alert() are environment-dependent and do not exist in the Node.js terminal environment, which is text-based and lacks visual dialog capabilities

- In a browser, the global object is `window`, while in Node.js, it is `global`. For example, to log the global object in a browser, we can use:
console.log(window);

- To do the same in Node.js, we use:
console.log(global);


REPL - Read Evaluate Print Loop
for example - node cli


Process and Environment 

Process

In Node.js, the process object is a global object that provides information about the current Node.js process and allows developers to interact with it. Some of the most commonly used properties and methods of the process object are:

- `process.argv`: an array that contains the command line arguments passed to the current process
- `process.pid`: the ID of the current process

- `process.env`: an object that contains the environment variables of the current process
get the process ENV
here's how you get the API_KEY's 

- `process.exit()`: terminates the current process with an optional exit code

npm link creates a symlink from the bin folder to our current js file
so everytime we call our cli command it basically runs this file


Modules 
- a self contained piece of code that performs a specific task.
- a piece of functionality that can be used in other parts of your application

Different types of modules
- Internal Modules
	fs - filesystem (read files, write files)


- User Created Modules
- Third Party Modules

Different kind of modules importing and exporting ways - modules (uses export and import) & commonjs (uses require and export.property)
